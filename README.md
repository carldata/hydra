# Hydra

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/carldata/hydra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carldata/hydra)

Stream processing engine which executes custom script written in [FlowScript](http://github.com/carldata/flow-script).

Interface to this engine is based on Kafka
 
## Quick start

### Run Kafka


Run Zookeeper and Kafka and create topics
```bash
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

Prepare Kafka. This should be run only once
```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic data
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic hydra-rt
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic hydra-batch
bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --list
```

 ```bash
sbt assembly
java -jar target/scala-2.12/hydra.jar 
 ```

Run consumer to listen to the topic:

```bash
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic data
```

### Feed some data

Use [Theia](https://github.com/carldata/theia) as a data generator.


### Datadog metric type
